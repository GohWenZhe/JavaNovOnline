1. Have these values, car manufactures year, car price and car name. Then pass a value which can calculate care price multiply car manufactured year.

2. Create a new private and public classes that can get at least 3 cars, model, make and price from the terminal, and then calculate the average prices of the cars and show it in the terminal.

2.1. Use the code in assignment 2 and use if and else statement so, if the average car prices are higher than the 100,000 the output shows the cars are expensive if its between 50,000 to 99,999 the output shows the cars are normal price and if it is less than 49,999 it shows the cars are cheap

2.2. Do the same as 2.1 just instead of if and else statement use ternary operator

3. Create a loop that uses the for loop whtich begins from the number 1 and adds single number each. it continues till it breaks at number 26. Use break at number number 26 and continue in number 14

4. Create a Matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns which contains the car models and prices then fetch the car which values above 50,000 RM and portray it in the terminal

5. Use scanner to get the prices of the 5 different cars from the terminal and if the value of the car is equal or above 70000 RM, put them in the matrix of 2*2 which shows the value, "VIP", "2024", "pre-order" and if the value is below the 70000 put them in the matrix of 2*2 which shows the value, "Cheap", "old", "for sale"
